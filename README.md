# 🏠 Linear Regression - House Price Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project implements **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression** to predict house prices using the **Housing Price Prediction Dataset**. The task was completed as part of an **AI & ML Internship** and follows all steps provided in the mini-guide.

---

## ✅ Task Objectives
- Understand and apply **Linear Regression** using scikit-learn
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Train and evaluate the model using standard regression metrics
- Visualize the results and interpret model coefficients

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Preprocessing and encoding categorical data
- Splitting dataset into training and test sets
- Training a Linear Regression model using `sklearn.linear_model`
- Evaluation metrics: **MAE, MSE, R²**
- Plotting Actual vs Predicted values
- Interpreting feature coefficients
